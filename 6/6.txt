6. Fibonacci Series
Problem Description:
Write a program to generate the first n terms of the Fibonacci series. The Fibonacci series is defined as follows:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1.
Input:
A single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
Output:
Print the first n terms of the Fibonacci series.
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1: 5
Output 1: 0 1 1 2 3
Input 2: 7
Output 2: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
